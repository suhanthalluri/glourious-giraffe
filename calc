BMI Calculator
//BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).
//1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables. Use prompt to collect the data
//2. Calculate both their BMIs
//3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
//4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true").
var markmass = prompt("Mark, what is your mass?")
var Johnmass = prompt("John, what is your mass?")
var markheight = prompt("Mark, what is your height?")
var Johnheight = prompt("John, what is your height?")
